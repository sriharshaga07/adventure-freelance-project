        <h1 class="aboutHead">About us</h1>
        <p class="para-about"><b>Back in 2012, I was doing research for a presentation and stumbled upon a big problem.</b> <br>
          India had tons of people with degrees, but companies couldn't find enough qualified workers! <br>
          Graduates were stuck without jobs, while big companies didn't hire them. <br><br>
          <b>This surprised me, especially considering how many people live in India.</b><br>
          After digging deeper, I discovered a huge gap in skills: only 3 out of 100 people were considered <br>
          "ready" for good jobs. Many ended up stuck in low-paying roles like customer service, while <br>
          countries like the UK and USA zoomed ahead. <br><br>
         <b> I had experience both in business (startups) and teaching (tutoring), and I wanted to <br>
          use both to help young people succeed.</b><br>
          So, after 7 years in the corporate world, I took a leap - I quit my job and started a learning center <br>
          called Adventure Academy. <br> <br>
         <b>Adventure Academy isn't just about getting good grades.</b><br>
          We help students develop important skills like problem-solving and thinking critically.We encourage <br>
          them to try new things, learn from their mistakes, and discover what they're good at. <br> <br>
          <b>We also have a digital marketing company.</b><br>
          This gives us real-world examples to teach our students, helping them overcome their fears <br>
          and step into the world of possibilities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container-small">
        <p>In short, Adventure Academy is all about empowering students to become confident, <br>
          skilled individuals who can tackle any challenge!</p>
